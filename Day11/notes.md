# 📝 Day 11 Notes

## ✅ What I Learned  

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that accept other functions or return them.  
- **Closures**: Functions that "remember" values from their outer scope.  
- **Decorators**: Special functions that wrap other functions to modify behavior.

## 🔥 Observations  

- Higher-order functions help keep code reusable and modular.  
- Closures can be used to create **stateful** functions.  
- Decorators are useful for logging, performance tracking, and authorization.
