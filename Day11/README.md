# Day 11 - Advanced Python Functions: Decorators, Higher-Order Functions, and Closures

## 📌 Task  

Today, we will:  

- Learn about **higher-order functions** (functions that take other functions as arguments).  
- Understand **closures** (functions that remember values even after execution).  
- Explore **decorators** (a way to modify function behavior).

## 🚀 Steps  

### 1️⃣ Higher-Order Functions  
- A function that takes another function as input or returns a function.

### 2️⃣ Closures  
- A function that captures variables from its enclosing scope.

### 3️⃣ Decorators  
- A special type of function that modifies another function.

## 🏆 Challenge  

Modify the script to:  

- Create a higher-order function that applies a given function to a list.  
- Implement a closure that keeps track of how many times a function is called.  
- Write a decorator that measures function execution time.
