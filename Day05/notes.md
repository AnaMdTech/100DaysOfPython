# 📝 Day 5 Notes

## ✅ What I Learned

- Learn how python randomize it uses Pseudorandom Number Generators
- Learn what `module` means in python 
- Learn how to use them in another module/project by using `import` keyword with `random` for randomization in python
- Learn how to generate random numbers floats and techniques to make them whole numbers
- Learn what `Lists` are and what it is used for
- Learn to create lists and perform operations like accessing, adding or removing items and more.
- Learn about IndexError & that you can put Lists inside other Lists (2D Lists)
  ``` python
  fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
  veg = ["Cucumber", "Kale", "Spinach"]
  fruits_and_veg = [fruits, veg]
  #The list would look like this: [["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"], ["Cucumber", "Kale", "Spinach"]]
  ```
- Learned how to get the length of a list (number of items in the list) or the length of a string (number characters in the string) by using the len() function.
  
## 🔥 Observations

- The random module is used to generate a random numbers and others random things to work with like in games
- Using import is vital for using another files in to your project
- Lists are one of most important data structure in python that holds a collection of ordered items
- We can perform plenty operations on lists like accessing items etc...
- IndexError is one of errors associated with lists, and we handle it with being caution with our list length items hold
- And We can get the length of our list items using `len()`
