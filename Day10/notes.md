# 📝 Day 10 Notes

## ✅ What I Learned  

- **Recursion**: A function can call itself with a base case to prevent infinite loops.  
- **Lambda Functions**: Short, one-line functions used when a simple function is needed temporarily.  
- **Function Scope**:  
  - Local variables exist inside a function.  
  - Global variables exist throughout the program.  
  - Nonlocal variables are used in nested functions.

## 🔥 Observations  

- Recursion is useful for breaking down complex problems but must have a base case.  
- Lambda functions improve readability but should not be overused.  
- Understanding scope helps prevent variable conflicts.
