# Day 1: Introduction & Setup

## 📌 Task

Today, we will:

- Install Python (if not installed)
- Set up a code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any preferred editor)
- Write and run a simple Python program that prints a message

## 🚀 Steps

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open your code editor and create a new file named `main.py`
3. Copy and paste the following code into `main.py`:
   ```python
   print("Welcome to 100 Days of Python! 🚀")
   ```
4. Save the file and run it:
   - On Windows, open **Command Prompt** and type:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```
   - On Mac/Linux, open **Terminal** and type:
     ```sh
     python3 main.py
     ```

## 🏆 Challenge

Modify the script to ask for the user's name and print a personalized message.

Example:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to 100 Days of Python! 🚀")
```
