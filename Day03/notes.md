# üìù Day 3 Notes

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

- Learn about the primitive data types in Python.
  - Strings
  - Integers
  - Floats
  - Booleans
- Learn about Type Error, Checking & Conversion
  - Type Error: These errors occur when you are using the wrong data type. e.g. len(12345)
  - Learn how to check the data type of any value or variable in python using the type() function.
  - Learn how to convert data into different data types using special functions. e.g.
    - float()
    - int()
    - str()
    - bool()
- Learn to use the basic mathematical operators, +, -, *, /, // and **
- Learn to use PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction
- Learn how to manipulate numbers & Assignment Operators
- Learn how to use f-strings to insert a variable or an expression into a string.
  - ``` python
    age = 12
    
    print(f"I am {age} years old")
    
    # Output: I am 12 years old 
    ```

## üî• Observations

- Python has four main primitive data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans, each serving a unique purpose.
- Type errors occur when incompatible data types are used together, such as trying to get the length of an integer.
- The `type()` function is useful for checking the data type of variable before performing operations on it.
- Type conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()` help in converting values between different types.
- Python follows PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) for mathematical operations, ensuring proper order of execution.
- Integer division (//) returns a whole number, while normal division (/) returns a float.
- Assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= help in updating variable values efficiently.
- f-strings provide a cleaner and more readable way to format strings with variables and expressions.
