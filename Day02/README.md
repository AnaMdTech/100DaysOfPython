# Day 2: Variables & User Input

## 📌 Task

Today, we will:

- Learn how to print messages to the console using `print()`
- Work with strings and manipulate them
- Use the `input()` function to get user input
- Store values in variables for later use
- Understand Python's variable naming rules

## 🚀 Steps

1. Printing to the Console:
    ``` python
   print("Hello, Python World!")
   ```
2. Using Variables:
    ``` python
    name = "Ana"
    print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
   ```
3. Taking User Input:
    ``` python
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print("Hello, " + user_name + "! Nice to meet you.")
    ```
4. Understanding Variable Naming Rules:
    - Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
    - Must start with a letter or underscore (_), not a number.
    - Cannot use Python keywords as variable names.

## 🏆 Challenge

Modify the script to:

- Ask for the user's name and age.
- Print a message using both values.

Example:

``` python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.")
```
